Project Overview: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Heart Failure Clinical Records

Project Description

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing clinical records of 299 heart failure patients. The dataset includes 13 clinical features, and the objective of the analysis is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights related to heart failure and its associated factors.

The project involves:
	â€¢	Data Import & Preprocessing: Loading the dataset, converting categorical variables, and ensuring clean data representation.
	â€¢	Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing key numerical and categorical variables.
	â€¢	Visualization: Using histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, and regression lines to explore data distributions and relationships.
	â€¢	Correlation & Regression Analysis: Evaluating relationships between key medical indicators using Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient and linear regression models.

Tools & Packages Used

Programming Language
	â€¢	Python (main programming language)

Key Libraries Used
	1.	Data Handling & Processing
	â€¢	pandas: For data import, manipulation, and cleaning.
	â€¢	numpy: For numerical operations like mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation calculations.
	2.	Data Visualization
	â€¢	matplotlib.pyplot: For creating histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, and regression lines.
	3.	Statistical Analysis
	â€¢	Custom Functions: The project manually implements standardization of variables, Pearson correlation coefficient, and least squares regression using numpy.
	â€¢	scikit-learn (sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression): Used for linear regression modeling, extracting slope & intercept, and validating previous manual calculations.

	â€¢	Structuring data in a way that facilitates analysis.
	2.	Descriptive & Inferential Statistics
	â€¢	Using statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) to summarize data.
	â€¢	Understanding the distribution and variability of medical variables.
	3.	Data Visualization & Interpretation
	â€¢	Bar plots for categorical variables.
	â€¢	Histograms for numerical variables (age, sodium levels).
	â€¢	Overlayed histograms for comparison (sex vs. age distribution).
	â€¢	Scatter plots with regression lines for analyzing relationships (e.g., Age vs. Sodium Levels).
	4.	Correlation & Regression Analysis
	â€¢	Computing Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient to determine relationships between variables.
	â€¢	Using least squares regression to identify trends.
	â€¢	Validating statistical calculations with sklearn (industry-standard method).
	5.	Machine Learning Readiness
	â€¢	The project lays the foundation for predictive modeling by identifying key features related to heart failure.
	â€¢	The dataset and techniques used could be extended to classification models, such as logistic regression or decision trees, for predicting heart failure outcomes.

Key Takeaways for Industry Roles
	â€¢	Data Analyst / Data Scientist
	â€¢	Strong use of pandas and numpy for data handling.
	â€¢	Understanding of data preprocessing and feature engineering.
	â€¢	Application of statistical analysis & visualization for insights.
	â€¢	Healthcare Analytics / Financial Risk Modeling

	â€¢	Machine Learning & AI
	â€¢	The use of linear regression with sklearn aligns with industry practices in predictive modeling.
	â€¢	Could serve as a baseline for more advanced AI models for healthcare risk assessment.

Next Steps for Industry-Level Improvements

To make this project more applicable for industry use:
	1.	Feature Engineering
	â€¢	Create more meaningful derived features (e.g., patient risk score).
	â€¢	Handle missing data properly.
	2.	Advanced Modeling
	â€¢	Apply logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks to classify patient outcomes.
	â€¢	Use scikit-learn for model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC-ROC).
	3.	Automated Reporting
